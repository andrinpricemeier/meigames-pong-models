# Pong AI player models

## Model ideas

* Analyze learning curve / training curve for bias/variance
* Collect more data
* Perhaps try a sequential model (RNN, Transformer, Attention, TCN)

Accuracy Dummy classifier: 0.32

Accuracy kNN classifier: 0.78

Accuracy Random Forest classifier: 0.81

## Ideas

* kNN
* Offline RL
